# My First Software Development Repository

## About Me
I am a software development student learning to build applications using Python and other programming languages.

## What I Have Learned About Software Versioning
- Version control helps track changes to code over time
- Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project
- Branches let us work on features without affecting the main code
- Commits save snapshots of our work with descriptive messages
- Pull requests allow team members to review changes before merging
- Repositories store all project files and their history

## Skills Developed
- Creating and managing repositories
- Working with branches
- Making commits with meaningful messages
- Understanding the pull request workflow
